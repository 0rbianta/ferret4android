 * Ferret parses TCP streams a single byte at a time. In most cases,
 * the buffers it is looking for are located in the current packet.
 * In some cases, however, they will span a packet boundary and need
 * to be reassembled. In such cases, we will do 'late' reassembly.
 * This means that in the normal case, we will simply point to the
 * strings in the buffer. Only when parsing 'runs off the end' of a 
 * packet will we actually allocate a buffer and copy the string off
 * into that buffer. We only have ONE string like this at a time while
 * parsing TCP. Once we finish parsing the string, we must either
 * parse-and-forget it, or allocate-and-remember it. There are other
 * data structures that can handle the remembering of strings and
 * automatic disposal.
