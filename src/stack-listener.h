 * Register that we know about a protocol running on certain port number on
 * a machine so that when we see a connection to that port in the future,
 * we know what protocol that connection will be.
 *
 * The traditional example of this is FTP whose command channel runs on
 * port 21, but whose files are transferes on connections to other ports.
 * We must therefore parse FTP on port 21 to find the ip:port numbers
 * for the file transfers.
 *
 * A more recent example is VoIP, where SIP packets occur on one port to
 * to set up a call, and where the call using RTP runs across arbitrary
 * other ports. We must therefore parse SIP packets in order to find
 * the ports that RTP runs over.
